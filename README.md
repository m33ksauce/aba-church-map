# ABA Church Map

## What is it?

It's a site that helps you find local ABA churches within a specific range, or find a particular ABA church.

## Why are you doing this?

We want people to be able to find ABA churches. While ABA churches aren't the only place you can find Gospel preaching, many people prefer to join services with ABA churches when they travel. We've also heard that missionaries often have trouble locating ABA churches or nearby churches that might be interested in having a visiting missionary. We also believe that it's a good idea to visualize this data for use among our association.
